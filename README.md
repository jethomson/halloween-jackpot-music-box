# halloween-jackpot-music-box

Code for the ATtiny861 to make it an audio player of Halloween and jackpot sound effects.
The music box will play audio clips from three different directories on an SD card: win, fail, and halloween.
The audio files aren't distributed with this project because I do not own the rights to them.

This work is based on the work of ChaN at Electronic Lives Manufacturing.
